<h1 class="category-title"> Who I am </h1>
<p>Born on 24th of December 1990, I have spent most of my life in Ankara, Turkey. Having blessed with generous and loving parents I was able to get a good education and pursue my dreams to become an Electrical Engineer and soon (hopefully by September 2016) a business manager focused on digital innovation and management of technology. Truly, I've been always amazed with technology and how fast it has settled in every essence of our social life through the past years, thus choosing a career path in communications, design and management of these systems, I wanted dedicate my life to creating useful tech. But I have to admit although I always had the passion to take the next step and tackle every challenge coming my way regarding my educational and professional life, music and skateboarding have been an important (really important!) part of my life  which kept me motivated, inspired and most likely sane.</p>
